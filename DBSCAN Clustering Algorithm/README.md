## DBSCAN Algorithm
# Overview:
DBSCAN is a popular clustering algorithm designed to identify clusters of points in a dataset based on their density. Unlike k-means, DBSCAN does not assume that clusters have a spherical shape or similar sizes. It is particularly useful for datasets with irregular shapes and varying cluster sizes.

## Key Concepts:

# Density-Based Clustering:
DBSCAN groups data points that are close to each other and have a sufficient number of neighbors into dense regions.
It identifies clusters as areas of the dataset where there is a higher density of points.

## Core Points, Border Points, and Noise:

# Core Points: 
Points with a minimum number of neighbors (specified by min_samples) within a defined distance (eps). These points start a new cluster or expand an existing one.
# Border Points: 
Points within the eps distance from a core point but with fewer neighbors than required to be a core point. They are part of a cluster but not a core member.
# Noise: 
Points that are neither core nor border points. They do not belong to any cluster.


## Algorithm Steps:
1. Randomly select a data point.
2. If it has the minimum number of neighbors (min_samples) within the distance eps, it becomes a core point, and a new cluster is formed.
3. Expand the cluster by adding all reachable points within the eps distance to the cluster.
4. Repeat the process until all points are visited.

## Parameters:
* eps: The maximum distance between two samples for them to be considered as in the same neighborhood.
* min_samples: The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point.

## Advantages:
1. Can discover clusters of arbitrary shapes.
2. Robust to outliers and noise.

# Limitations:
1. Sensitivity to the parameters eps and min_samples.
2. Struggles with datasets of varying densities.

# Usage:
Commonly applied in spatial data analysis, image segmentation, and anomaly detection.
